This event requires attention to the subtleties of speed, as bouncing back too far up the starting ramp can result in significant loss of bounce-back distance, as the vehicle travels again back toward the elastic barrier.

                            In Season 1, if multiple Regular Season events were held on the same day, vehicles that had won an event were allowed to compete in subsequent events that day. Therefore, on June 22nd, 2020, Ice Cream Van completed a "Bifecta" by winning two events on the same day, and hence the need for thirteen Regular Season events that season in order to reach twelve cars for the Champions League. After Season 1, this rule was changed. Winners of an event cannot compete in any further events in the Regular Season, no matter if events are held on the same day. Thus, Ice Cream Van is the only vehicle to ever accomplish this feat.

Due to his expanded role as not only a new team manager, but also for having spent his first year on earth as the league's Chief Operating Officer, the Board voted unanimously and without hesitation to rename the league the Damon & Felix Die-Cast Racing League, previously known as the Damon Die-Cast Racing League, and before that, in Season 1, the Damon Racing League.

                            Though not without a valiant effort, as the league expanded, league statisticians were unsuccessful in cataloguing all vehicles that had retired from the league. Retirement is now only noted for Champions League vehicles. Common reasons for retirement are bent axles or a re-evaluation of general vehicle performance capabilities, though some retirement curiosities can be noted: Seasons 8 and 9 were plagued by the phenomenon of vehicles of identical casting and paint detailing being pooled along with the original league-certified vehicles of that casting and paint. Because it was often impossible to tell the original vehicle from the imposters, the original vehicles were mandated to retire. The league Board Members acknowledged that the decision to retire these vehicles was based in no part on the actions of the vehicles themselves, and it regretted the error. Finally, two vehicles from Team Benny: Coors Truck and Ketchup Mustard, while technically being retired after Season 3 due to performance-related issues, were deemed none-the-less
                            eligible to compete in future events under the "Legends of Racing" historical stipulation, which honors vehicles of significant historical or sentimental value. To date, neither vehicle has exercised their right to return to the track.
